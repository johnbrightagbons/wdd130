      <h3>Examination</h3>
      <p>
        <br>Examination</br>
        We at Unibright know the importance of examination and as such have structured our examination to help us: <br>1. evaluate and grade our learners <br>2. motivate our learners to study<br>3. add variety to the learner study<br>4. identify weakness and correct them<br>5. get feedback on our lessons
        <br>6. provide statistics for the lesson and school<br> 7. accredit qualified students. </br>
        <br>How do we decide what to test and how to test it?</br>
        Our overall examination is consistent with your learning outcomes for the course outline. There are a number of ways we review skills and concepts taught in our course outline. We could:
        Use the topics list provided in the course outline
        Review your lecture notes to find major concepts 
        Review the chapter headings and subheadings in the assigned readings
        <br> What are the qualities of our exam? <br> Our exam affords all our students an equal opportunity to totally show their learning: We normally reflect on the nature and parameters of our exam.<br> Consistency: If students sit for the same exam twice, they should get a similar grade each time.
        <br>Validity: We make sure our questions address what we want to evaluate.
        <br> Use of multiple question types: Different students are better at different types of questions. In order to have all the students show their abilities, exams questions are varied to multiple questions, theory, practical etc.
        <br> Free of bias: Since our students are from all over the world with different socio-economic background, religion, language, political background etc, we try to eliminate anything that make serve as an obstacle to their students exams.
        <br> Timely: We exams spread throughout the term with students given adequate time to apply the feedbacks left by the instructors.
