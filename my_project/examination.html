            <h1>Examination</h1>
                <p> We at Unibright know the importance of examination and as such have structured our examination 
                    to help us: <br>
                    1. Evaluate and grade our learners <br>
                    2. Motivate our learners to study <br>
                    3. Add variety to the learner study <br>
                    4. Identify weakness and correct them <br>
                    5. Get feedback on our lessons <br>
                    6. Provide statistics for the lesson and school <br>
                    7. Accredit qualified students <br>

            <p><h1>How do we decide what to test and how to test it?</h1>
                <p> Our overall examination is consistent with your learning outcomes for the course outline. 
                There are a number of ways we review skills and concepts taught in our course outline. We could: <br>
                 Use the topics list provided in the course outline <br>
                 Review your lecture notes to find major concepts <br>
                 Review the chapter headings and subheadings in the assigned readings <br>
                 
                <h1>What are the qualities of our exam?</h1>
                1. Our exam affords all our students an equal opportunity to totally show their learning: 
                We normally reflect on the nature and parameters of our exam. <br>
                2. Consistency: If students sit for the same exam twice, they should get a similar grade each time. <br>
                3. Validity: We make sure our questions address what we want to evaluate.<br>
                4. Use of multiple question types: Different students are better at different types of questions. 
                In order to have all the students show their abilities, exams questions are varied to multiple questions,
                 theory, practical etc. <br>
                5. Free of bias: Since our students are from all over the world with different socio-economic background, 
                religion, language, political background etc, we try to eliminate anything that make serve as an obstacle
                 to their students exams.<br>
                6. Timely: Our exams spread throughout the term with students given adequate time to apply the feedbacks
                 left by the instructors. <br>
