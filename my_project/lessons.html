            <h2>Evaluation</h2>
            <p> Each lesson has evaluation that tests our students on the lesson covered. 
                This helps us to measure student progress, reform our lessons, to improve learners' personality
                 and enhance accountability for outcomes.

            <h2>Lesson 1</h2> <br> <b>DEFINITION OF COMPUTER</b> 
            <p> Computer is defined as an electronic device capable of accepting data, processing data,
                storing data and producing an output called information following a set of instructions called program.
                It is also seen as an electronic device for storing and processing data, typically in binary form, 
                according to instructions given to it in a variable program. <br>
                A computer is a digital electronic machine that can be programmed to carry out sequences of arithmetic
                or logical operations automatically. Modern computers can perform generic sets of operations known as 
                programs. These programs enable the computer to do a variety of tasks. <br>
            </p>
            <b>PARTS OF A COMPUTER</b> <br>
            The basic parts of a computer system are: <br>
            1. System Unit <br>
            2. Monitor <br>
            3. Keyboard <br>
            4. Mouse <br>
            5. Speaker
            </p>
            <b> CHARACTERISTICS OF A COMPUTER</b> <br>
            The Characteristics of computer include: <br>
            1. Accuracy: The results produced by computers are very correct. <br>
            2. Diligence: Computers are free from tiredness, dullness and lack of concentration. <br>
            3. Large Storage Capacity: Computers can store very large amount of data. <br>
            4. Speed: Computers process data at a very high speed. <br>
            5. Automatic: A device is said to be automatic if it can complete tasks on it own. Computers once started on a task can complete such task without human intervention. <br>
            6. Versatility: Computers can be used to perform different tasks.

            <h2>Lesson 2</h2> <br> <b>DATA AND INFORMATION</b> 
            <p> <b>What is data?</b> Data is a raw fact or observation about a person, place, thing or event.
                Data is an unorganized fact, a fact that has not been worked upon or processed. Data is meaningless,
                and may not make a complete sense. Data is unreliable as its context can change. Examples of data are alphabets (A, B, C or a, b, c), 
                numbers (0 - 9), characters, symbols etc. <br>
                <b>What is information?</b> Information is a processed fact. It a data that has been converted into a meaningful
                context, and therefore makes a complete sense. It can also be seen as an organized data. Examples of information
                are, the total number of people in Nigeria, the total number of girls in a school, the result of an exam,
                the number of workers in a factory etc. <br>
            </p>
            <p><b>DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DATA AND INFORMATION</b><br>
                1.	Data is a raw fact while Information is a processed data <br>
                2.	Data is unreliable while information is reliable <br>
                3.	Data is not significant	but information is significant<br>
                4.	Data cannot be used for decision making	but information can be used <br>
                5.	Data is meaningless	but information is meaningful <br>
                6.  Data is unorganized while information is organized <br>

            <h2>Lesson 3</h2> <br> <b>DATA PROCESSING</b> 
            <P><b>Meaning of data procesing</b> <br>
                Data processing can be defined as the process of gathering data from various sources performing
                some required actions on them in order to convert them into meaningful context for decision making.
                It simply means the process of changing data into informaation. Before data is used for making any decision
                such data need to be converted into a meaningful context, the process of converting such data to information 
                is termed data processing.
            </P>
            <p><b>STAGES OF DATA PROCESSING</b><br>
                The following are stages or cycles of data processing; <br>
                1. Data gathering or data collection stage <br>
                2. Data preparation stage <br>
                3. Input stage <br>
                4. Processing stage <br>
                5. Output stage <br>
                6. Storage stage
            </p>
            <p><b>IMPORTANCE OF THE COMPUTER AS A PROCESSING TOOL</b> <br>
                The importance of computer as a processing tool include; <br>
                1. Increased accuracy <br>
                2. Efficient storage Capacity <br>
                3. Easy retrieval of information <br>
                4. Fast access to information <br>
                5. Handle difficult tasks <br>
